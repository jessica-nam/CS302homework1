# Sample Execution & Output

You and your friends spontaneously decide to leave everything behind and start your dream life in New Zealand.
I created this program to assist you all on your journey.

What is your name: Jessica
How old are you? 19

Your train leaves very soon! Quick! Choose three things to pack!
>>> First item: clothes
How much do/does your clothes weigh? 5.5

>>> Second item: books
How much do/does your books weigh? 9.1

>>> Third item: cat
How much do/does your cat weigh? 12.3

Currently you have 26.9 pounds of luggage on the train.
You decide you have too much to carry. You need to leave your cat behind. 
Now you have 14.6 pounds of luggage on the train.

You are all packed. Now let's get on the bus.
Choose two friends to take with you!
>>> First friend: Jenna
How old is Jenna? 19

>>> Second friend: Megan
How old is Megan? 19

Jessica has boarded the bus!
Jenna has boarded the bus!
Megan has boarded the bus!
Uh oh! Megan forgot their ticket.
Megan has left the bus!


The train and bus are taking off!
